```assembly
; Check if ebx points to a valid buffer with sufficient space
mov ecx, [ebx+0x18] ; Get the buffer size
cmp ecx, 0x20  ; Check if buffer has at least 32 bytes
jge check_passed
; Handle the case when the buffer is not sufficiently large
jmp handle_error

check_passed:
mov eax, [ebx+0x10]
add eax, [ebx+0x14]
mov [ebx+0x18], eax

;Jump to this label if there was not enough space
handle_error:
;Error handling code here: example to gracefully handle the error
; ...
; exit gracefully
mov eax, 1 ; sys_exit
xor ebx, ebx ; exit code 0
int 0x80
```
This improved version checks the buffer size before accessing it, preventing an overflow if the buffer is too small.  Error handling logic is essential in a production environment to gracefully manage such situations.
