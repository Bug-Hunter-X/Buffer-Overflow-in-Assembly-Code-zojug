```assembly
mov eax, [ebx+0x10]
add eax, [ebx+0x14]
mov [ebx+0x18], eax
```
This code snippet attempts to add two values from memory locations relative to `ebx` and store the result.  However, it's susceptible to a buffer overflow if `ebx` points to a memory location that doesn't have enough space allocated beyond `ebx+0x14`.

The problem is that there's no bounds checking. If `ebx` points to a small buffer, accessing `[ebx+0x14]` or writing to `[ebx+0x18]` could overwrite adjacent memory, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
